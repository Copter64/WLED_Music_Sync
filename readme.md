### Installation and Setup

1. Download the latest release of `WLEDMusicSync.zip`
2. Extract all contents to a folder
3. Ensure you have the following structure:
   ```
   WLEDMusicSync/
   â”œâ”€â”€ WLEDMusicSync.exe   # Main application
   â”œâ”€â”€ timings.yml         # Light show configuration
   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ controllers.yml # WLED device settings
   â””â”€â”€ songs/             # Your music files
       â””â”€â”€ song1.mp3      # Music files go here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Double-click `WLEDMusicSync.exe` or run from command line:
   ```powershell
   .\WLEDMusicSync.exe --timings timings.yml
   ```

2. Select a song from the menu to begin playback

### Playback Controls
- Space: Play/Pause
- Left/Right: Seek Â±5 seconds
- Page Up/Down: Seek Â±30 seconds
- Up/Down: Volume control
- R: Restart current song
- Q: Quit application

## Configuration Files

### Controller Configuration (config/controllers.yml)
```yaml
controllers:
  controller_id:
    urls: 
      - "http://wled-device1.local"
      - "http://wled-device2.local"
    description: "Controller description"
    type: "WLED"
```

### Timing Configuration (timings.yml)
```yaml
songs:
  "song-file.mp3":
    - time: 0.0
      controllers:
        controller_id:
          preset: 1
    - time: 5.0
      controllers:
        controller_id:
          scene:
            on: true
            fx: 85
```

For detailed information about timing configuration, including all available options and examples, see [Timing Configuration Guide](readme_timings.md).

## Adding New Songs

1. Add the MP3 file to the `songs` directory
2. Add the song entry to `timings.yml` with your desired light show configuration
3. Update any preset mappings in `controller_presets.txt` if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Production/Executable Mode)
1. Missing DLL Errors
   - Ensure the executable wasn't quarantined by antivirus
   - Try running as administrator
   - Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable if needed

2. File Not Found Errors
   - Verify all required files are in the correct locations
   - Check that `timings.yml` is in the same directory as the executable
   - Ensure the `config` and `songs` directories are present

3. WLED Connection Issues
   - Check that the WLED devices are accessible from your network
   - Verify the URLs in `config/controllers.yml` are correct
   - Try using IP addresses instead of hostnames

4. Audio Problems
   - Check Windows audio settings
   - Try running the executable as administrator
   - Verify MP3 files are not corrupted

5. Performance Issues
   - Close other applications using significant CPU
   - Ensure adequate free RAM (minimum 2GB recommended)
   - Try running with `--dry-run` to test timing accuracy
