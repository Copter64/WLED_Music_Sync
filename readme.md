## Configuration

### Controller Configuration (config/controllers.yml)
```yaml
controllers:
  controller_id:
    urls: 
      - "http://wled-device1.local"
      - "http://wled-device2.local"
    description: "Controller description"
    type: "WLED"
```

### Timing Configuration (timings.yml)
```yaml
songs:
  "song-file.mp3":
    - time: 0.0
      controllers:
        controller_id:
          preset: 1
    - time: 5.0
      controllers:
        controller_id:
          scene:
            on: true
            fx: 85
```

For detailed information about timing configuration, including all available options and examples, see [Timing Configuration Guide](readme_timings.md).

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode:

1. Set up your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py --timings timings.yml
   ```

3. Optional utility scripts for development:
   ```bash
   # Fetch presets from WLED controllers
   python fetch_presets.py
   
   # Update preset comments
   python update_preset_comments.py
   
   # Upload presets to WLED controllers
   python wled_preset_uploader.py
   ```

### Production Mode (Windows Executable)

A standalone Windows executable is provided that doesn't require Python installation:

1. Required Files and Structure:
   ```
   WLEDMusicSync/
   â”œâ”€â”€ WLEDMusicSync.exe   # The main executable
   â”œâ”€â”€ timings.yml         # Light show timing configuration
   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ controllers.yml # WLED controller configuration
   â””â”€â”€ songs/             # Music and timing files directory
       â”œâ”€â”€ song1.mp3      # Music files
       â”œâ”€â”€ song1.txt      # Timing file for song1
       â”œâ”€â”€ song2.mp3
       â””â”€â”€ song2.txt
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   WLEDMusicSync.exe --timings timings.yml
   ```

3. Configuration Requirements:
   - `config/controllers.yml`: Must contain your WLED device URLs
   - `timings.yml`: Must list all songs and their timing events
   - `songs/`: Directory must contain both MP3 and timing files
   - All paths in configuration files should be relative to the executable

### Command Line Arguments
- `--timings`: Path to the YAML timing configuration file (required)
- `--song`: Specific song to play (optional)
- `--dry-run`: Test mode - logs actions without sending to controllers

### Playback Controls
- Space: Play/Pause
- Left/Right: Seek Â±5 seconds
- Page Up/Down: Seek Â±30 seconds
- Up/Down: Volume control
- R: Restart current song
- Q: Quit application

### Utility Scripts (Development Only)
- `fetch_presets.py`: Retrieve presets from WLED controllers
- `update_preset_comments.py`: Update preset comments
- `wled_preset_uploader.py`: Upload presets to WLED controllers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Development Mode)
1. WLED Connection Failures
   - Verify controller URLs in `config/controllers.yml`
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure WLED devices are powered and connected

2. Missing Songs
   - Verify MP3 files are in the `songs` directory
   - Check timing file names match song files
   - Validate entries in `timings.yml`

3. Playback Issues
   - Check Python and pygame installation
   - Verify audio device settings
   - Check file permissions

### Common Issues (Production/Executable Mode)
1. Missing DLL Errors
   - Ensure the executable wasn't quarantined by antivirus
   - Try running as administrator
   - Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable if needed

2. File Not Found Errors
   - Verify all required files are in the correct locations
   - Check that `timings.yml` is in the same directory as the executable
   - Ensure the `config` and `songs` directories are present

3. WLED Connection Issues
   - Check that the WLED devices are accessible from your network
   - Verify the URLs in `config/controllers.yml` are correct
   - Try using IP addresses instead of hostnames

4. Audio Problems
   - Check Windows audio settings
   - Try running the executable as administrator
   - Verify MP3 files are not corrupted

5. Performance Issues
   - Close other applications using significant CPU
   - Ensure adequate free RAM (minimum 2GB recommended)
   - Try running with `--dry-run` to test timing accuracy
